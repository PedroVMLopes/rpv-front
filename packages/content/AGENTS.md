# `@rpv/content` — Agent Context

Content **sources, catalog, and system-specific curation**. Read the root
`AGENTS.md` first for the project philosophy. This file covers the rules
specific to this package.

## Role

This is where authored/curated content lives and where **system-specific data
is allowed** (the engine in `@rpv/domain` must stay system-agnostic). Content is
expressed as **declarative data** that the engine interprets — never as
per-item/per-class code branches. The platform's goal is community-created
content, so anything an author could plausibly create must be representable as
data here.

## What lives here

- `open5e/` — client + types for the Open5e data source (the D&D source feed).
- `spell/`, `race/` — types + mappers that turn raw source data into catalog
  entries (`*.mapper.ts`, `*.types.ts`).
- `catalog/` — the assembled `Catalog` (races, spells, skills, languages) and
  locale overlays. The base catalog is authored in `defaultLocale`; locale
  overlays are partial, so any missing slug/field falls back to the base text.
  Never assume a translation exists. Built via `scripts/buildCatalog.ts`
  (`npm run build:catalog`).
- `grant/` — the **`Grant`** model: the declarative description of what a piece
  of content gives a character.
  - `grantType`: `ability_score | stat_modifier | ability | skill_proficiency |
    weapon_proficiency | tool_proficiency | armor_proficiency |
    saving_throw_proficiency | language | spell`
  - `choose === 0` → fixed (everything applies); `choose > 0` → the player picks
    `choose` entries from `options` or from a `selectionFilter` pool.
  - `grants.ts` is the **bridge**: it converts `Grant`s into domain `Modifier`s
    and `CharacterGrant`s. This is how authored content feeds the engine. Keep
    this translation generic — driven by the grant data, not by hardcoded names.
- `curation/*.dnd.ts` — **hand-curated, D&D-specific** content (class, race,
  background, item grants). The `.dnd.ts` suffix marks data as belonging to the
  D&D system.

## Rules

- **Content = data.** New content (items, classes, subclasses, races, …) is
  added as `Grant`/catalog data, not as new engine logic. If you find yourself
  writing `if (slug === "fighter")` in code, model it as data instead.
- **Tag the system.** System-specific files use a system suffix (`*.dnd.ts`). A
  future system (e.g. Pathfinder) adds its own source mappers and `*.pf2e.ts`
  curation files — without modifying `@rpv/domain`.
- **Reuse shared primitives.** Map content onto existing `Grant` / `Modifier` /
  `StatKey` / `CharacterGrant` shapes so content from different authors and
  sources interacts predictably. Extend primitives generically only when a truly
  new capability is required (and prefer doing the generic part in `@rpv/domain`).
- **Catalog references use slugs.** Grants reference catalog entries by slug;
  resolution against the catalog happens through the provided helpers.

## Exports & tests

- Public surface is re-exported from `src/index.ts`. Add new modules there.
- Tests live in `__tests__/`. Run with `npm test` in this package.
- Depends on `@rpv/domain`; the dependency only goes one way (content → domain,
  never the reverse).
